# Jerrys-Onboarding-Checklist
### Sales Operations üõ†Ô∏è 

- [ ] Introduce yourself to @joeyj20, our Field Operations specialist.  
- [ ] Schedule 30 minutes with @joeyj20 once you have accounts and opptys assigned to you.  She can walk through things that are important to know from field ops' perspective.
- [ ] For your top few accounts, spend time familiarizing yourself with SFDC info at the Account level - Contracts, Opportunities, Microsoft info.
- [ ] Review open Opportunity records and spend time familiarizing yourself with key fields - Sales Stage, Forecast Category, Close Date, MSFT co-sell or direct, Next Steps, etc.  Also review the primary quotes to familiarize yourself with common SKUS - GHE, VS step-up bundles, GHAS, PS, etc. 
- [ ] Walk through creating a quote your buddy or another team mate.  Understand the differences between quoting direct and MSFT opptys.

The Field Ops team is magical, and they can help with just about any licensing, quoting, booking question or situation that comes up.  Use the appropriate Slack channels to get help.

### Territory Management üó∫Ô∏è 

- [ ] Run a report in SFDC to show all accounts assigned to you (SFDC>Accounts>My Accounts).  Compare this to the list from your manager.  If there are any discrepancies ask your manager to have them fixed, i.e. change account owner in SFDC.
- [ ] Look at [example Territory Plans](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4551/views/1?visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C106736%2C106737%2C106738%2C106740%2C106741%2C106742%2C106744%2C106745%2C106747%2C106748%2C106755%2C106756%2C106863%5D) in GitHub and find one you like, or modify an existing one.  
- [ ] Prioritize and organize accounts - Tier A, B, C.  Tier A is where you'll spend the majority of your time, represents significant revenue growth potential, the customer's approach to sw development aligns with GitHub's value drivers, etc.  Tier C are accounts that you'll mostly operate in reactive mode.  
- [1] For your A and B accounts, capture when the next renewal date is (direct or MSFT EA) to understand if you have any near-term opportunity to upgrade a renewal.  
- [ ] Identify GHAS accounts and whitespace across your territory.  
- [ ] Other things that are helpful to capture for each account - ARR, is the customer on GHES, GHEC, or hybrid? how many total developers? any newly acquired companies to onboard to GH?

### Account Management üìö 

- [ ] For tier A and B accounts, do internal account research to understand history, open issues, etc.  GitHub and Slack are the best sources of info! 

**GitHub repos:**
Deal-Desk
Sales
EBC
Advanced-security-field
Field-operations

**Slack** - use the global search (cmd-G) for account intel.

- [ ] Setup (or ask to copy someone else's) Issue templates for call plans and customer meeting notes.  Here is an [example](https://github.com/github/libbys01/issues/153).
- [ ] It's worth taking 30 minutes or so to watch some basic markdown tutorials to help you make changes to or write your own Issue templates.  If you don't know what this is yet, don't worry about it.  Come back to it when you find yourself wanting to create a template from something you capture frequently in a GitHub repo (i.e., call plans, customer meeting notes, etc.).

### Pipeline Assessment & Clean-up üîª 

- [ ] Create a SFDC report at the Opportunity level and filter for all your open opportunities in current quarter.
- [ ] Review opportunities and identify which ones are new/upgrade v. renewals.  

For the renewals, identify which ones are on MSFT paper (check "microsoft involvement" field or Microsoft tab).  These will happen automatically, but just be aware of the timing in the quarter.  MSFT renewals closing the last week of the quarter should be moved to the first 2 weeks of the following quarter to allow for processing.

For the direct renewals, make sure quotes have been sent to customers.  We are responsible for creating and sending renewal quotes, but Field Ops can answer any questions or help with quote questions and issues.  

- [ ] For all new or upgrade opportunities, validate the oppty is still valid.  Are the next steps current? How long has the oppty been open?  Who is the customer contact?  Is the SE currently engaged?  Is the MSFT team involved, or can they help?

### Self-Education üè´ 

- [ ] Schedule focus time every week to watch previous Universe keynotes sessions, watch product demos, go through internal education resources, YouTube videos, podcasts, etc. 

### MSFT Teaming ü§ù 

- [ ] For your Tier A and B accounts, identify the MSFT Account/Client Exec (AE), Adv Technology Strategist (ATS), Commercial Exec - handles all the contracts, Enterprise Agreements (CE), App Innovation Specialist, Customer Success Managers
- [ ] Use [Calc](https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4551/views/1?visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C106736%2C106737%2C106738%2C106740%2C106741%2C106742%2C106744%2C106745%2C106747%2C106748%2C106755%2C106756%2C106863%5D) to look up MSFT account team members by account.  The tool isn't the most intuitive, so ask your buddy for help.  Here are high-level steps:

- Select Account Management
- Enter account name and select only "Sales Account" in the Profile Type.
- Select a parent account from the list - one that has a MSSALESID defined.  It may take a few tries to get to the right account instance.  
- Select the Team tab on the next screen.  If it's empty you'll need to go back out and select a different account instance.
- Scroll all the way over to "Role Type" and filter by "ATU".  You should at a minimum see Account Executive, ATS, and a bunch of specialists.  Even if you only find the AE or ATS, it's all you need.  

- [ ] Reach out to MSFT account team members in Teams and introduce yourself.  Ask to be included in any account team calls, get access to Team sites with account docs, etc.  

The ‚òùÔ∏è are all great things to walk through with your buddy. üë•
